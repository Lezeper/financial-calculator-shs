        This project is part of my SHS (Smart Home System).
        Will change to Angular 2 and Angular 2 material when it
        release the final version.
## Main Features
        * Account balance prediction for a period. Remind me what is
          the lowest balance for each accounts during this period.
        * Calculate purchase category rewards.

## Q&A
####   Why you move business logic to backend?
        Because I may change front-end framework quite frequently.
        For backend, I only want to use MongoDB and Node as my framework.
####   Is it data validator in front and backend do different job?
        Yes, it will do more job in the front-end for displaying purpose.
        For backend, we assume the date is valid Date or moment object,
        not null or undefined.
####   Is it support Account with same name?
        Yes
####   Is this application support multiple user?
        No. Currently it is only designed for self-use.
####   When should I update my account?
        By the end of the day. Because all the transaction on the 
        updated day will not accounted.
####   When should I use schema reference?
        When you want to add other schema with the latest info.
####   Why Reward Rule can't update?
        Reward Rule is defined as a single instance attached to
        account default.
## TODO
        Auto Generate Statement
        Monthly Statement
        direct deposit center
        loading page
        pending show change
        can I spend $XX on XX?
        how much rates I need to have?
        use reward to pay options
        change use accountname + card# as name and key
## Issue
        1. moment object add/substract method will replace variable.
        But format method will not.
